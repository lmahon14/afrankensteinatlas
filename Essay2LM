Essay #2: Wollstonecraft, Death, and the Influence They Had on Shelley’s Writing of Frankenstein:
How did Mary Wollstonecraft’s influence Mary Shelley’s work—how is it represented throughout Frankenstein?
While this will encompass Wollstonecraft’s writings and feminist beliefs that are so clearly represented in Shelley’s work, it will also encompass Wollstonecraft’s death how that is reflected throughout Frankenstein. 
This JSTOR piece inspired this idea, and also builds upon what the author found: https://daily.jstor.org/mary-shelleys-obsession-with-the-cemetery/ 
I am unsure, at present, what my multimodal addition will be for this essay.
